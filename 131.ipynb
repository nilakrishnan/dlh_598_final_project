        "\n",
        "Deep learning models are an essential part of big data anlaysis within healthcare. Neutral networks are utilized to optimally predict future diagnosis, hospital readmission, drug interaction, treatment recommendation, etc. Specifically, graph neural networks (GNNs) are vital to drug discovery, molecular property prediction, and other drug interaction prediciton tasks; one example is drug pair scoring, the prediciton task of determining the relationship between a pair of drugs, based on the known effects of various other drug pairs. Some specific predictions between drugs include drug-drug interaction, synergy, and polypharmacy side effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "While there are open-scource drug interaction libraries available, they often predict based on a single molecule and do not allow for drug synergy predictions, predicting if the combined effect of a pair of drugs is more effective than the additive effect of each drug separately. There is no multi-use, streamlined framwork that is easily accessible by machine learning researchers.\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper introduces ChemicalX [1], a library of PyTorch implementations of 11 prominent deep-learning models that predict various drug-drug interactions. Aside from the drug pair scoring deep-learning model architectures, this library also provides data loaders, integrated benchmark datasets, training, and evaluation routines.\n",
        "\n",
        "All ChemicalX models were trained and tested across multiple datasets to predict drug-drug interaction, synergy, and polypharmacy side effects; and all models were evaulated using AUPRC, AUROC, and F1 metrics. Finally, the authors address use cases of the library by oncologists, computational chemists, drug safety researchers, and various oher machine learning researchers.\n"
